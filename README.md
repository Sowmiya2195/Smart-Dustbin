Smart Dustbin (IoT/Arduino)
        A smart dustbin using Arduino/ESP8266 that monitors waste levels. An ultrasonic sensor detects when the bin is full and sends real-time notifications to a mobile app or web dashboard. Buzzer alerts when full for timely cleaning.

Components:
1.Arduino / ESP8266 / ESP32
2.Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
3.Buzzer
4.IoT Server / Mobile App

Working:
1. Sensor measures dustbin fill level.
2. If full → buzzer alert + IoT notification.
3. If not full → normal monitoring continues.
